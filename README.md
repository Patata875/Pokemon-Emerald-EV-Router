The aim is to be able to see how many EVs you get from various trainers in Pokemon Emerald.

I've also added Exp/Levels, IVs and Natures to see potential stats for various Pokemon.

Most of the data is gathered from an Excel spreadhseet. You should be able to change the values in the spreadsheet if you want to add/remove/change the data of trainers/pokemon.

Note - This is my first proper coding project, so not sure how well it actually works. I've tried to fix bugs/issues as I've found them, but unfortunately I don't much time to validate that all the data is correct.
